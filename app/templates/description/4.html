<p>Kung Pao chicken, (Chinese: 宫保雞丁; pinyin: Gōngbǎo Jīdīng; Wade–Giles: Kung1-pao3 Chi1-ting1; Jyutping: gung1 bou2 gai1 ding1), also transcribed as Gong Bao or Kung Po, is a spicy stir-fry dish made with chicken, peanuts, vegetables, and chili peppers. The classic dish in Szechuan cuisine originated in the Sichuan Province of south-western China and includes Sichuan peppercorns. Although the dish is found throughout China, there are regional variations that are typically less spicy than the Sichuan serving. Kung Pao chicken is also a staple of westernized Chinese cuisine.</p>

<p>
The dish is believed to be named after Ding Baozhen (1820–86), a late Qing Dynasty official, and governor of Sichuan Province. His title was Gongbao (Kung-pao; Chinese: 宫保; pinyin: Gōngbǎo; Wade–Giles: Kung1-pao3; literally: "Palace Guardian").[1] The name "Kung Pao" chicken is derived from this title.

<p>During the Cultural Revolution, the dish's name became politically incorrect because of its association with Ding. The dish was renamed "Fast-fried chicken cubes" (Hongbao Jiding) or "chicken cubes with seared chiles" (Hula Jiding) until its political rehabilitation in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Versions commonly found in the west, called "Kung Pao chicken" or "Kung Po", consist of diced marinated chicken stir-fried with orange or orange juice, ginger, garlic, chicken broth, sugar, cooking oil, corn starch, and salt and pepper to taste. The dish often includes or is garnished with whole roasted peanuts. Other versions substitute beef, pork or seafood for chicken.</p>

<p>The original version includes Sichuan peppercorns, which from 1968 until 2005 were illegal to import into the United States (they were viewed as potential carriers of citrus canker, a tree disease that can harm citrus crops).[4] The ban was lifted in light of new processing methods, but the 37-year ban resulted in versions without Sichuan peppercorns.</p>
